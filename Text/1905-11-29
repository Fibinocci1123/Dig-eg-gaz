            <p>The latest accounts from Sevastopol vary as
            regards details, but they seem to indicate that
            the mutiny is subsiding.</p>

            <p>The situation at Sevastopol is very obscure,
            but it appears that the mutiny is of a revolu-
            tionary character. It began by the rews of the
            Panteleimon and Otchakoft hoisting the red
            flag on the 24th November. They then landed
            and held a meeting at which a deputation of a
            Brest regiment swore that the whole regiment
            would defend the sailors to their utmost. Both
            soldiers and sailors afterwards paraded the
            streets waving red flags.</p>
            <p>Admiral Pisareviki was wounded while in
            the act of ordering the troops to fire on the
            mutineers. Several officers were killed and
            many arrested. The two vessels are still flying
            red flags, and the fortress artillery have refus-
            ed to fire upon them.</p>

            <p>The Panteleimon is now in the hands of the
            authorities, but the mutinied crew and soldiers
            have shut themselves up in one of the bar-
            racks. It is desired to attack them, but it is
            feared that the artillery men may join them. A
            part of the Odessa garrison is disposed to
            make common cause with the mutineers.</p>

            <p>The president and numerous members of
            the peasants congress here have been arrested
            owing to incendiary speeches. The governor-
            General has been dismissed for allowing them.</p>

            <p>The attitude of the army is the most serious
            feature in the situation. It is admitted here
            that a spirit of revolt pervades the whole army
            from Vladivostok to the Baltic. The Manchu-
            rian forces are in a condition of almost open
            rebellion. The garrison of this city has form-
            ulated demands involving the complete remo-
            delling of the conditions of service. Business is
            at a standstill.</p>

            <p>Thousands of Russian prisoners who have
            arrived from Japan have mutinied. They at-
            tacked the Officers' Club yesterday, killing and
            wounding four officers. The Cossacks have
            restored order.</p>

          HUGE DEMONSTRATION.</head>

            <head>Vienna, November 28.</head>
            <p>To-day the Socialists organised a huge or-
            derly universal suffrage demonstration on the
            occasion of the opening of the Reichsrath.
            Two hundred thousand men were present. A
            deputation was favorably received by the Go-
            vernment.</p>

            <p>A demonstration, in which, it is estimated,
            200.000 persons took part, has been held
            here in favor of universal suffrage. A similar
            demonstration took place at Prague.</p>
