	<head>THE MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES.</head>
	<p>All most acknowledge the immense amount
	of care and labour expended by Professor
	Maspero and his staff in successfully moving a
	vast mass of antiquities from Ghizeh to the
	new museum without the loss or injury of a
	single object of importance, and in arranging
	them. The achievement was most remarkable;
	it demands and deserves the sincere homage
	of all who can realise the difficulties and
	the risks involved in so great an undertak-
	ing. But there is a certain incomplete-
	ness, a something lacking in the new
	Museum of Antiquities. The building, the
	antiquities, the staff of the Service — all
	are there, but we miss the educational
	functions of a museum, and their absence
	inspires the present criticism, made with no
	intention of mere fault-finding or causing
	pain to officials who have laboured strenuously
	in the cause of Egyptology, but rather to
	point out to the authorities the right way
	to make the museum more interesting and
	of greater value to the world than is the case
	at present.</p>
	<p>What is the purpose of a museum? Is it
	merely a safe in which curious or valuable
	objects are preserved, or is it an educational
	institution appealing, it is true, more to those
	already instructed than to the general public,
	but educational in its functions none the less?
	We oould not justify the large sums of public
	money, that have been expended on the
	museum building if this were not the case,
	and it is only on such grounds that the annual
	grant of public funds to the Antiquities
	Department can be justified. But, if the object
	of the museum is educational, why is so little
	done to fulfil it? Why is the museum so
	useless for purposes of study, so poorly
	equipped for them in comparison with all the
	first-class collections of the Continent and
	Great Britain? What other museum but pos-
	sesses a large stock of folly descriptive labels
	attached to all important objects, whether they
	be Greek vases, rare lepidoptera, or unique
	geological specimens?</p>
	<p>We may be referred to the catalogue, but
	    the small catalogue does little but give the
	    visitor who chooses to buy it a. superficial idea
	    of the general arrangement of the objects
	    while the great catalogue—a monumental work—
	    is so vast, so cumbersome, and so expensive
	    as to be inaccessible to the majority. Descrip-
	    tive labels are entirely lacking in some cases,
	    while in others the objects are provided with
	    cards bearing perhaps the name of a king or a
	    dynasty. But this is not enough. How can
	    comparative study be carried on unless we are
	    told whence an object comes, and of what it
	    is a part. A statue or a piece of sculpture
	    bearing the name of Thothmes III. may come
	    from anywhere between Dongola and the
	    Mediterranean, but the cards are dumb.</p>
    <p>And this neglect is worse than unwise, it
        is not business when it affects a series of
        objects which the museum may owe to the
        special liberality of donors, among whom we
        include those who pay  the cost of special
        excavations. Would it not be well, pour en-
        courager les autres, to give their names, and to
        provide fully descriptive labels for the objects
        which their efforts or their money have caused
        to be brought to light? All who have the
        pleasure of knowing the genial and kindly
        Director of the Department of Antiquities
        must realise that this neglect to which we call
        attention is due to forgetfulness, and could
        never arise from any desire to overlook or to
        exclude what we venture to claim as no more
        than a public right.</p>

<p>The London and North Western Railway
    (England), after exhaustive trials and mature
    experience, have decided, not only to equip
    all the new rolling stock they build with
    Stone’s System of Electric Lighting but they
    have also abandoned the use of oil gas and
    dismantled the gas fittings from over 1,100
    carriages and substituted in place of same
    Stone's System of Electric Lighting. This
    change has already been made, with results
    entirely satisfactory both to the travelling
    public and to the Railway Company. This
    Railway Company alone has 4,000 carriages of
    all types (from ordinary suburban carriages to
    their latest type of dining and sleeping saloons)
    fitted with Stone's System of Electric Lighting
    and Ventilating.</p>
