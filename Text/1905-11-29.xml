                            regards details, but they seem to indicate that

                        <p>The situation at Sevastopol is very obscure,
                            but it appears that the mutiny is of a revolu-
                            tionary character. It began by the rews of the
                            Panteleimon and Otchakoft hoisting the red
                            flag on the 24th November. They then landed
                            and held a meeting at which a deputation of a
                            Brest regiment swore that the whole regiment
                            would defend the sailors to their utmost. Both
                            soldiers and sailors afterwards paraded the
                            streets waving red flags.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Pisareviki was wounded while in
                            the act of ordering the troops to fire on the
                            mutineers. Several officers were killed and
                            many arrested. The two vessels are still flying
                            red flags, and the fortress artillery have refus-
                            ed to fire upon them.</p>

                        <p>The Panteleimon is now in the hands of the
                            authorities, but the mutinied crew and soldiers
                            have shut themselves up in one of the bar-
                            racks. It is desired to attack them, but it is
                            feared that the artillery men may join them. A
                            part of the Odessa garrison is disposed to
                            make common cause with the mutineers.</p>

                        <p>The attitude of the army is the most serious
                            feature in the situation. It is admitted here
                            that a spirit of revolt pervades the whole army
                            from Vladivostok to the Baltic. The Manchu-
                            rian forces are in a condition of almost open
                            rebellion. The garrison of this city has form-
                            ulated demands involving the complete remo-
                            delling of the conditions of service. Business is

                        William's speech at the opening of the Reich-

                        good and friendly.</p>

                        internal affairs of Russia, and that he is
                        gratified by the conclusion of an agreement
                        with regard to the question of Morocco, which

                    <head>THE BEYRAM FESTIVAL.
                    CELEBRATIONS IN CAIRO.</head>
                    <p>Full hotels, swarms of uniforms, and a
                    clouding sky, with a bitter wind: so the
                    Beyram holiday opened in Cairo. It spite of
                    the cold weather and threats of rain the public
                    had made up its mind to enjoy itself. The
                    Mena trams were full early, multitudes went
                    out to Helouan, but the streets were by no
                    means crowded or eve unusually full, though
                    it was holiday, perhaps in consequence of late
                    hours and feasting the night before. Near
                    Abdern a good many people had congregated
                    to watch the arrivals fot the reception, which
                    was, as usual, very largely attended by the
                    higher ranks of the military and civil branches
                    of the Government, by the officers of the Army
                    of Occupation, and those for whom official
                    Egypt- or was it official France 1- has devised
                    the term of "notables."</p>
                    <p>A very strong official and lay contingent
                    was furnished by Alexandria, provincial no-
                    tables were "up" and staying at all the best
                    hotels, and the rain very considerately held off
                    till near the close of the reception, when a few
                    drops fell and thickened to a steady drizzle
                    that lasted with occasional intermissions well
                    into the afternoon.</p>
                    <p>The Moslem Benevolent Society gave a fete
                    in the Esbekieh Gardens, which were decorated
                    for the occasion and illuminated at nightfall.
                    All sorts of music was to be heard, conjurors
                    kept a crowd, which contained a large pro-
                    portion of soldiers, amused and cheerful
                    despite a low temperature and wet grass.
                    Acrobats and strong men performed before
                    audiences that increased gradually as the
                    afternoon wore on, and at night came the
                    fireworks and coloured lights. The streets were
                    thoroughly muddy, deep in that peculiarly
                    sticky mud that is so characteristic of Cairo,
                    but no one seemed to care particularly. The
                    Egy[tian is easily pleased, and his calm acqui-
                    escence in all that is, makes him indifferent to
                    a cold and wet Beyram.</p>

                    <p>We have the pleasure to announce to our
                    readers, says "Al Moayad," that Lord Cromer
                    has intervened in regard to the disputs which
                    recently occured between Moslems and Christ-
                    ians at the American Mission's School at Cairo,
                    on account of a sermon which touched Moslem
                    sentiment. His lordship has seen Dr. Watson,
                    and required him to put an end to the policy
                    of the preachers as regards the Moslem religion.
                    His lordship has a so ordered the Hakamdar of
                    the Cairo police to give the police strict orders
                    as to the manner in which they must act in
                    similar circumstances.</p>
                    <p>The Mohamedans, continues our contempo-
                    rary, will be pleased to learn of Lord Cromer's
                    great solicitude on their behalf, and the respect
                    he pays to national feelings. We hope, "Al
                    Moayad" concludes, that Lord Cromer's policy
                    will have a good effect upon missionaries in
                    Egypt and that they will learn to be peaceful

                    has arrived here on her maiden trip to India
                    and has brought a large consignment of

                    Bombay by the Afghanistan, to play for the
                    session in one of the largest hotels there, gave
                    a concert last night at Government House.
                    No entrance fees were charged, and the
                    place was crowded, a very enjoyable evening
                    being spent. The orchestra consists of 14 per-
                    formers, all males, under Bandmaster Coke.</p>

                    is no sharaki land whatever in the Tahta

                    cultivated, and wherever one goes luxuriant
                    vegetation is to be seen, arguing well for the

                    <head>SHEPHEARD'S SMALL DANCE.
                    OPENING OF THE SEASON.</head>
                    <p>Quite a number of peopl took part in the
                    small dance at Shepheard's on Saturday night,
                    and though there was a great preponderance
                    of men present, everybody seemed cheery and
                    bent on amusement. Sir Elwin Palmer looked
                    in for a short time, and the Hon. Fred Morgan
                    was very busy among his friends. The Hon. C.
                    James and Mrs. James were there, the latter in
                    a pretty fresh green silk frock draped with lace
                    and velvet. The beautiful Mme Vernon was
                    surrounded, as usual, by her little court,
                    though she did not take part in the dancing;
                    Brigadier-General Bullock, Mr. Webb, and Mr.
                    Leigh Hunt (who is at present staying at
                    Shepheard's), were also onlookers, and among
                    the latest residents we noticed Mr. and Mrs.
                    E.C.G. Porter, who brough a few friends.
                    Mrs. Porter, who has a beautiful, slight figure
                    looked remarkably well in black crepe de chene
                    with a deep lace berthe. There were several
                    other pretty frocks in spite of it being quite an
                    informal occasion and still early in the season.
                    One Empire gown was a filmy black chiffon
                    enriched by a heavy Greek design in black
                    velvet, and hanging from a deep yoke, etc., of
                    cream lace. The velvet trimming outlined the
                    yoke and sleeves, and faint touches of coral
                    pink gave a touch of colour to the lace. A
                    black sequined net had wide insertions and
                    folded ceinture of delicate Pompadeur silk;
                    and a handsome fair woman was magnificent in
                    apricot-coloured "chiffon veleurs" draped with
                    lace. A young girl was wearing a soft grey
                    spotted crepe-de-chene over an under robe of
                    cream chiffon, the crossed drapery of the
                    decollatage being edged with tiny quillings of
                    cream; and there were one or two handsome
                    cream satin gowns draped with lace.</p>
