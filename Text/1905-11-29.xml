                    <head>OUR VISITOR.</head>
                    <p>Two of the greatest, if not the very greatest,
                        of his Majesty's Pro-Consuls, have met to-
                        gether for a brief period in this land. Lord
                        Curzph, after a short stay in Cairo as the
                        guest of Lord Cromer, has left us to con-
                        tinue his journey home after quitting the
                        scene of his Viceregal labours, and after
                        sacrificing his physical health and, latterly, his
                        happiness, on the altar of patriotic duty. In
                        an age when self-seeking is not unknown even
                        among statesmen of high quality Lord Curzon
                        has concentrated all his endeavours on the
                        consolidation and development of that wonder-
                        ful creation, the rule of a handful of his fellow-
                        countrymen over a fifth or a sixth of the
                        world's inhabitants. That was the mission he
                        undertook when he first went to India, but
                        long before, with the thoroughness which has
                        marked his public career throughout, he sedu-
                        lously prepared for its accomplishment by
                        persistent study of whatever Asiatic problems
                        touched the ground plan of his coming cam-
                        paign. When he gave up the brilliant posi-
                        tion he had won for himself at home some
                        wondered at his decision; it seemed to them
                        that he was surrendering the substance of per-
                        sonal greatness for what might easily prove
                        an evanescent shadow. But those friendly
                        critics had never plumbed the inner depths
                        of Lord Corzon's idiosyncrasy. He had, of
                        course, great ambitions and far-reaching
                        aspiration, of a more or less personal charac-
                        ter; no statesman worthy of the name is
                        unequipped with longings for permanent fame.
                        But it stands to the lasting credit of the retir-
                        ed Viceroy that from the date of his arrival in
                        India he unswervingly devoted himself to the
                        promotion of that country's most vital inte-
                        rests, political, military, and commercial.
                        He was the builder; he left it to poste-
                        rity to prenounce on his skill in adapting
                        to modern requirements the almost miracu-
                        lous ediface founded by those immortals,
                        the two Wellesleys, Clive, and Hastings.
                        Lord Curzon will have no occasion to wait
                        long for that national judgment; indeed it
                        has already delivered in the universal regret
                        what circumstances should have conspired to
                        abbreviate his retention of the Vicereyship.
                        ____ it is a safe prediction that when he lands
                        in England, he will be quickly made to feel that
                        no living British statesman holds higher posi-
                        tion in the national esteem that the great Pro-
                        Consul who, as a last sacrifice, gave up his
                        career on what he regarded as a point of duty.</p>

                        <p>The situation at Sevastopol is very obscure,
                            but it appears that the mutiny is of a revolu-
                            tionary character. It began by the rews of the
                            Panteleimon and Otchakoft hoisting the red
                            flag on the 24th November. They then landed
                            and held a meeting at which a deputation of a
                            Brest regiment swore that the whole regiment
                            would defend the sailors to their utmost. Both
                            soldiers and sailors afterwards paraded the
                            streets waving red flags.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Pisareviki was wounded while in
                            the act of ordering the troops to fire on the
                            mutineers. Several officers were killed and
                            many arrested. The two vessels are still flying
                            red flags, and the fortress artillery have refus-
                            ed to fire upon them.</p>

                        <p>The Panteleimon is now in the hands of the
                            authorities, but the mutinied crew and soldiers
                            have shut themselves up in one of the bar-
                            racks. It is desired to attack them, but it is
                            feared that the artillery men may join them. A

                        <p>The attitude of the army is the most serious
                            feature in the situation. It is admitted here
                            that a spirit of revolt pervades the whole army
                            from Vladivostok to the Baltic. The Manchu-
                            rian forces are in a condition of almost open
                            rebellion. The garrison of this city has form-
                            ulated demands involving the complete remo-
                            delling of the conditions of service. Business is
                            at a standstill.</p>

                            good and friendly.</p>
                        <p>He added that he sympathised keenly with

                            internal affairs of Russia, and that he is
                            gratified by the conclusion of an agreement
                            with regard to the question of Morocco, which
                            originated in the tendency to ignore German
                            interests. He regarded peace as a sacred thing,

                    <head>THE BEYRAM FESTIVAL.
                        CELEBRATIONS IN CAIRO.</head>
                    <p>Full hotels, swarms of uniforms, and a
                        clouding sky, with a bitter wind: so the
                        Beyram holiday opened in Cairo. It spite of
                        the cold weather and threats of rain the public
                        had made up its mind to enjoy itself. The
                        Mena trams were full early, multitudes went
                        out to Helouan, but the streets were by no
                        means crowded or eve unusually full, though
                        it was holiday, perhaps in consequence of late
                        hours and feasting the night before. Near
                        Abdern a good many people had congregated
                        to watch the arrivals fot the reception, which
                        was, as usual, very largely attended by the
                        higher ranks of the military and civil branches
                        of the Government, by the officers of the Army
                        of Occupation, and those for whom official
                        Egypt- or was it official France 1- has devised
                        the term of "notables."</p>
                    <p>A very strong official and lay contingent
                        was furnished by Alexandria, provincial no-
                        tables were "up" and staying at all the best
                        hotels, and the rain very considerately held off
                        till near the close of the reception, when a few
                        drops fell and thickened to a steady drizzle
                        that lasted with occasional intermissions well
                        into the afternoon.</p>
                    <p>The Moslem Benevolent Society gave a fete
                        in the Esbekieh Gardens, which were decorated
                        for the occasion and illuminated at nightfall.
                        All sorts of music was to be heard, conjurors
                        kept a crowd, which contained a large pro-
                        portion of soldiers, amused and cheerful
                        despite a low temperature and wet grass.
                        Acrobats and strong men performed before
                        audiences that increased gradually as the
                        afternoon wore on, and at night came the
                        fireworks and coloured lights. The streets were
                        thoroughly muddy, deep in that peculiarly
                        sticky mud that is so characteristic of Cairo,
                        but no one seemed to care particularly. The
                        Egy[tian is easily pleased, and his calm acqui-
                        escence in all that is, makes him indifferent to
                        a cold and wet Beyram.</p>

                        readers, says "Al Moayad," that Lord Cromer
                        has intervened in regard to the disputs which
                        recently occured between Moslems and Christ-
                        ians at the American Mission's School at Cairo,
                        on account of a sermon which touched Moslem
                        sentiment. His lordship has seen Dr. Watson,
                        and required him to put an end to the policy
                        of the preachers as regards the Moslem religion.
                        His lordship has a so ordered the Hakamdar of
                        the Cairo police to give the police strict orders
                        as to the manner in which they must act in
                        similar circumstances.</p>
                    <p>The Mohamedans, continues our contempo-
                        rary, will be pleased to learn of Lord Cromer's
                        great solicitude on their behalf, and the respect
                        he pays to national feelings. We hope, "Al
                        Moayad" concludes, that Lord Cromer's policy
                        will have a good effect upon missionaries in
                        Egypt and that they will learn to be peaceful

                    <p>Our Tahta Correspondent writes that there
                        is no sharaki land whatever in the Tahta
                        district this year. The lands have all been
                        cultivated, and wherever one goes luxuriant
                        vegetation is to be seen, arguing well for the
                        drops. Great praise is due to Hussein Bey

                        OPENING OF THE SEASON.</head>
                    <p>Quite a number of peopl took part in the
                        small dance at Shepheard's on Saturday night,
                        and though there was a great preponderance
                        of men present, everybody seemed cheery and
                        bent on amusement. Sir Elwin Palmer looked
                        in for a short time, and the Hon. Fred Morgan
                        was very busy among his friends. The Hon. C.
                        James and Mrs. James were there, the latter in
                        a pretty fresh green silk frock draped with lace
                        and velvet. The beautiful Mme Vernon was
                        surrounded, as usual, by her little court,
                        though she did not take part in the dancing;
                        Brigadier-General Bullock, Mr. Webb, and Mr.
                        Leigh Hunt (who is at present staying at
                        Shepheard's), were also onlookers, and among
                        the latest residents we noticed Mr. and Mrs.
                        E.C.G. Porter, who brough a few friends.
                        Mrs. Porter, who has a beautiful, slight figure
                        looked remarkably well in black crepe de chene
                        with a deep lace berthe. There were several
                        other pretty frocks in spite of it being quite an
                        informal occasion and still early in the season.
                        One Empire gown was a filmy black chiffon
                        enriched by a heavy Greek design in black
                        velvet, and hanging from a deep yoke, etc., of
                        cream lace. The velvet trimming outlined the
                        yoke and sleeves, and faint touches of coral
                        pink gave a touch of colour to the lace. A
                        black sequined net had wide insertions and
                        folded ceinture of delicate Pompadeur silk;
                        and a handsome fair woman was magnificent in
                        apricot-coloured "chiffon veleurs" draped with
                        lace. A young girl was wearing a soft grey
                        spotted crepe-de-chene over an under robe of
                        cream chiffon, the crossed drapery of the
                        decollatage being edged with tiny quillings of
                        cream; and there were one or two handsome
                        cream satin gowns draped with lace.</p>

                    <head>IV.</head>
                    <p>To deal with the large bodies of water that
                        have to be distributed over the extensive areas
                        of a basin chain, perfect control over the water
                        at all points is necessary. This is only to be
                        obtained by a sufficiency of regulating works,
                        such as head sluices, to draw the water from
                        the river into the feeder canal; basin sluices
                        to admit water from the canal into the basins;
                        regulators or escapes in the basin cross banks,
                        to pass on the water and regulate the level in 
                        the basins above them; and escapes to dis-
                        charge the water back into the river. The
                        arrangements of a basin system should be
                        devised with a two-fold object, namely, to get
                        the full benefit of a good flood and to guard
                        against the dificiencies of a low flood. In a good
                        flood as much water as possible should be
                        passed through the basins, so as to obtain a
                        maximum deposit of the fertilising matter
                        which is carried by flood water. To effect this,
                        the head sluice of the feeder canal should not
                        be closed when the basins are full, but should
                        be left open, and the levels in the basins re-
                        gulated by the opening of their escapes to the
                        necessary extent. In this way a quantity of
                        water is admitted to the basins in excess of
                        that required to fill them, and, as the current
                        in the wide expanse of water is imperceptible,
                        all the silt is thrown down before the water
                        passes away again, fertilizing the land surface
                        for the crop which will follow the retirement
                        of the waters. To guard against the deficiencies
                        of a low flood, the canals, as has been stated
                        above, should be dug so as to give a suffiency
                        of water, even in the most unfavorable years,
                        to cover all the lands, if only for a short time,
                        so that the ground may take up sufficient
                        moisture for maturing the coming crop- an
                        important matter, inasmuch as, if the opportu-
                        nity of soaking the land during the flood is
                        lost, the one crop that flood lands produce in
                        the year has no chance of being sown. It will be
                        easily understood that in bad years- in fact in
                        most years- the land near the point where a
                        basin feeder takes off from the river cannot
                        be reached by the flood water entering
                        the feeder. So these lands are served by the
                        canals belonging to the chain of basins next
                        above, their high-level water being carried in
                        syphon under the basin feeder of the next
                        lower chain. Provision is also made for pass-
                        ing on water from one basin to the next
                        so that, in case there remain some lands
                        untouched by the water when the time for
                        emptying the basins comes, their inundation
                        may be completed by raising the water level
                        in each basin in succession by the help of
                        the volume discharged into it from the basin
                        next above it.</p>
                    <p>The basin system is, however, destined to
                        give place to the perennial system of irriga-
                        tion, whereby not only are two crops a year
                        raised instead of one, but the average value
                        of each crop is hgiher than that of the single
                        crop grown on basin lands. In Upper Egypt, 
                        since the construction of the Assonen Dam,
                        a very considerable proportion of the pre-
                        viously existing basins has already been con-
                        verted to perennially irrigatied land. Conse-
                        quently, the method of irrigation by inunda-
                        tion is losing some of its importance as an
                        object of study. Moreover, what has been
                        written above describes in a general way the
                        principle of distribution of water by basins,
                        so that no further description need be given
                        of the working of this system. Those who
                        may have, hereafter, to control such irriga-
                        tion will naturally study the official records
                        and standard books on irrigation, which con-
                        tain a full record of the past twenty years
                        experience of responsible officials and the con-
                        clusions arrived at.</p>
                    <p>Let us return once more to the consideration
                        of the subject of perennial irrigation. The
                        possibility that the available supply of water
                        might be insufficient for the whole of a given
                        area requiring irrigation has been referred to
                        above. The insufficiency may not be recognised
                        in the first instance during the period of
                        design, but may be felt after the canals have
                        been in working order for some time, as a
                        result of an unexpected expansion of the
                        cultivated area depending upon the canal. Such
                        has been the case in Egypt, where, in con-
                        sequence of the remarkable development of
                        the country and the reclamation of uncultivated
                        areas, the summer supply of the Nile, at last,
                        proved insufficient, when fully utilised, to meet
                        the demand of the increasing areas of crops
                        depending on it for their irrigation. Con-
                        sequently it became necessary to study the
                        question of how to supplement the summer
                        supply of the Nile. As, during the flood and
                        winter seasons, a small proportion only of the
                        river discharge is utilised, while the greater
                        amount runs into the sea, the problem resolved
                        itself into one of storage of this surplus water
                        at those seasons. And so the Assouan Dam was
                        built, and a reservoir formed above it in the
                        valley of the Nile itself, wherein the summer
                        flood and winter surplus is stored for use in
                        the following summer as an addition to the
                        low supply; but even with this addition the
                        summer supply is still insufficient to meet the
                        demand, and additional means of supplement-
                        ing it are being studied. the problems connect-
                        ed with this question are somewhat intricate
                        but highly interesting. They are clearly stated
                        in an article by Sir William Garstin, which
                        appeared in the September number of the
                        "Nineteenth Century" under the heading
                        "Some Problems of the Upper Nile."</p>

                        <p>To the editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Eight months ago the residents of the
                            Zeitoun and Matarieh district were inveigled
                            into taking the company's water on the distinct
                            understanding that they were to be charged o
                            fixed amount based on the number of square
                            metre contained in their respective properties.
                            The price fixed by the Water Company was
                            accepted by the majority of the residents, who
                            relied upon the company's good faith when
                            assuring them that no charge would be made
                            in the system then instituted for assessing the
                            cost of water consumed.</p>
                        <p>A few days ago the Water Company issued
                            a circular to the subscribers informing tham
                            of their intention to place meters and that
                            water would in future be charged for at the
                            rate of P.T. 68.7 for the first 50 cubic meters
                            and 51 metres and upwards at the rate of
                            P.T. 1 per metre per month, and rental for
                            the meters at an all-around average of about
                            P.T. 10. Thsi works out at about double the
                            charge levied by the company hitherto, and is
                            no less than 82% dearer than the subscribers
                            residing at Ramleh pay the Alexandria Water
                            Co.</p>
                        <p>Most of the residents have given up their
                            sakkiehs and have in many instances gone to
                            considerable expense in laying down water-pipe
                            installations for their garden and house.</p>
                        <p>The company's action at the present junc-
                            ture of affairs is manifestly a gross abuse of
                            equity. Moreover an examination of the com-
                            pany's report and balance-sheet shows that the
                            receipts per 100 metres of water amounts to
                            P.T. 85, whilst the expenses, including the
                            board of administration, are only P.T. 20;
                            there is thus a profit of P.T. 63 per 100 metres
                            of water, equivalent to the enormous percentage
                            of 335%.</p>
                        <p>The Assiout concession shows 205% profit.</p>
                        <p>Having regard to the special condition
                            which obtained in the country formerly, the
                            policy of the Egyptian Government in granting
                            monopolies was no doubt a wise one and 
                            served a useful purpose, but surely the Govern-
                            ment of the present day, even supposing that 
                            they deem it expedient to grant further mono-
                            polies, should apply the necessary clauses to
                            safeguard the interests of the inhabitants
                            affected by them.</p>
                        <p>Water is one of the necessities of life and
                            the result of the latest decision of the Water
                            Company is already felt in a distinct upward
                            tendency in rents in Zeitoum.</p>

                            reduced to 5 milliemes per metre they would
                            still earn a profit of over 100%, a rate
                            exceeding the wildest dreams of the heads of
                            the most flourishing commercial concerns in

                        <head>THE PROTECTION OF ANIMALS.</head>
                        <p>To the editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Sir,- During my short residence in this
                            town, the one thing I find characteristically
                            cruel, if the maltreatment of the animals,
                            chiefly of horses. It has been my daily misfor-
                            tune to see these poor creatures trying to
                            draw the heaviest burdens, of which the
                            weight is obviously higher than their power.
                            This burden is often composed of building
                            materials, or, sometimes, of Arab women, who
                            sit down on the long carts by dozens and more,
                            perhaps, ignorant of the cruelty they are caus-
                            ing. Under these sad circumstances, no wonder
                            if it has been a common scene in the streets,
                            the falling down of the horses, who, exasperat-
                            ed and bloody as they are, again and again are
                            whipped to work even in their impotence. I
                            think the whip must be turned to the man,
                            and not to the animal. This fact is so obvious
                            and cruel, that it ought to call the attention
                            of all those who are concerned. The other day
                            I met a friend, a fanatic member of Animals
                            Protection Association, who was carefully read-
                            ing the annual report of the association, and

                        <head>RUY BLAS.</head>
                        <p>Victor Hugo's play perhaps showed the
                            Lambert company from a more characteristic
                            point of view than some of the pieces per-
                            sented. Here trandition, and that a most in-
                            teresting and admirable tradition, came before
                            us. Ruy Blas as a play represents so strongly
                            the reaction against Classicism, that it must
                            perforce establish a distinct school of acting.
                            This the Lambert company represent to the
                            full, much to our gain; and not only the
                            leaders, but all the performers acquitted
                            themselves well. M. Lambert fils was again
                            the chief figure, consistent, and excellent
                            throughout, as valet, toper, and Minister; the
                            great prophetic speech on decadent Spain
                            and her ruinous corruption was worthily
                            delivered; equally fine was the sequel, and
                            Ruy Blas' disguised master rose to the occa-
                            sion. Again, too, Mlle Delvair was brilliant,
                            every bold gesture and intonation telling. The
                            comic relief reminded us of Coquelin, but
                            why not? How could the returned exile do
                            better than follow such a model? The whole
                            play has a variety which was lacking in the
                            tragedy of Francois Coppee: not a word of
                            Severo Torelli but it tragic, fatal, so impas-
                            sioned as to be almost a strain: this the
                            greater master avoids, and so, fine as is M.
                            Coppee's rama, Ruy Blas is more a human
                            document, many-sided; and again one can
                            have nothing but praise for the actors who
                            represented so fully every side.</p>
                        <p>We would add one word, if perhaps the
                            management may accept it: why is the charge
                            of five piastres exacted for programmes? The
                            programme with the resume of the play has
                            apparently been suppressed, and though the
                            present pictorial document may have its inte-
                            rest, it is hardly worth the sum asked, espe-
                            cially as it does not seem to differ from night
                            to night except in the names of the characters.
                            And these we can see for nothing on the
                            poster. Let us hope this will not be in force
                            during the rest of the opera season.</p>

                        <head>LE MARQUIS DE VILLEMER.</head>
                        <p>The Lambert company had given as tragedy,
                            so far, classic and neo-classic, to except the
                            Vie de Boheme. The contrast brought out by
                            Le Marquis de Villemer was the more striking.
                            The story is- one must call it so- conventional,
                            and savour of its epoch; the good brother
                            the Marquis, and the bad brother the Duke,
                            and the well-born but ruined demoiselle de
                            compagnie. The Marquis falls in love with
                            her; the Duke, now reformed, solves the di-
                            lemma by marrying the heiress destined for
                            the Marquis, and promoting the marriage
                            of the other two. It is just one of those
                            plays which might drive one to think what
                            would the sequel have been. But the wit and
                            excellence of the book' carry off the con-
                            vention, and leave a certain fragrance, as of
                            Balzac, and a regret that such times are
                            past. Naturally the actors showed in a totally
                            different light; the stars were M. Marquet as
                            the Duke, and, of course, Mlle Delvair. The
                            perfection in each tiny detail was more
                            striking than ever, faultless, and convincing;
                            this same detail was at its height with M.
                            Marquet, the Duke, who had full play for his
                            wit; he is 'd'un esprit railleurs,' of that wit
                            which France possesses above all and which has
                            seemed to its possessors worth more at times
                            than anything this or the next world can give or
                            withhold. MM. Lambert, both father and son,
                            seemed less at their height: both were less
                            subtle, shall we say, less modern. Their talent,
                            as we have seen, is classical, of the Theatre
                            d"orange, of great measured lines, under the
                            moonlight against marble columns. There the
                            father's gestures, 'le geste noble,' and the son's
                            perfection of voice have their full effect. Yet
                            this does not imply that they failed in Georges
                            Sand's play: they are great actors, and if we
                            could wish for less gesture in the one, and less
                            tragic energy in the other, in a word for the
                            more delicate graduations of emotion which
                            we look for on the French stage of to-day, it
                            was only at moments: the harmony of the
                            whole to the note stuck by M. Marquet and
                            Mme. Delvair was never really disturbed: it
                            was more a case of noticing than of criticising.
                            The other parts were quite adequately filled,
                            more especially in the case of the Marquise,
                            and the scandal-loving Baronne. The staging,
                            as usual, was most careful, adn showed minute
                            study; that again we find at its height on the
                            French stage: no wonder a French play is
                            always worth seeing.</p>

                    <head>EGYPT'S MALADIES IN 1904.
                    INTERESTING STATISTICS.</head>
                    <p>The Sanitary Department of the Ministry of
                    the Interior has published a volume of statistics
                    dealing with the infectious diseases notified
                    throughout the country and deaths occuring
                    from the same towns and villages in each
                    quarter of 1904. The figures are very inte-
                    resting and afford a bird's-eye view of the
                    maladies of Egypt during last year. It is
                    very noticeable how fatal exanthermatic typhus
                    was at Cairo. Out of 1,085 deaths throughout
                    the whole of Egypt from this disease more
                    than half (593) occurred at Cairo. At Alex-
                    andria there were only 39 fatal cases. Typhoid
                    fever was responsible for 491 deaths, of
                    which 172 took place in Cairo and 125 in
                    Alexandria. Relapsing fever and malaria were
                    far more common in Cairo than in Alexandria.
                    No less than 31 person succumbed to relaps-
                    ign fever in Cairo and only 5 in Alexandria,
                    out of a total number of 201 fatal cases
                    for the whole of Egypt. Malaria was res-
                    ponsible for 369 deaths, of which 39 occurred
                    at Cairo and 3 at Alexandria. Malta fever
                    appears to be a specialty of Port Said, for
                    out of a total of 12 cases for all Egypt 10
                    were at that port. Of 13 fatal cases of erysi-
                    pelas, 6 occurred at Alexandria and the same
                    number at Cairo, and only one other in all the 
                    rest of the country.</p>
                    <p>Epidemic cerebro-spinal meningistis was con-
                    fined to Alexandria, where there were 20 out
                    of the total 21 cases. Of these 11 were fatal.
                    Rabies claimed 16 deaths, 7 at Cairo and 4 at
                    Alexandria. Influenza terminated fatally in 85
                    cases, of which 18 were at Cairo and 6 at
                    Alexandria. There were 19 deaths from lepro-
                    sy. Medinet el-Fayoum had no less than 4
                    fatal cases out of the total, the balance being
                    spread in even proportions all over Egypt.
                    Puerperal fever terminated fatally in 215 cases,
                    of which 75 were at Cairo and 44 at Alexan-
                    dria. There were 136 deaths from whooping
                    cough, of which 72 were at Assiout, 31 at
                    Suez, 16 at Cairo, and 3 at Alexandria. Small-
                    pox was responsible for 1,093 and measle for
                    5,260 deaths. Diphtheria was very fatal out
                    of 586 fatal cases for all Egypt.</p>

                    <head>THE DROP IN EGYPTIAN STOCK.</head>
                    <p>The recent decline in some of the leading
                    Egyptian securities known to the market, such
                    as shares of the National Bank of Egypt, the
                    Agricultural Bank of Egypt, the Land Bank of
                    Egypt, and the Daira Sanieh Company (says a
                    London contemporary), is an incident that had
                    been anticipated for some time past. The great
                    prosperity of Egypt in late years has produced
                    speculation in the financial centres of the
                    country, supported to a certain extent by
                    Continental operators. Prices of many securi-
                    ties have been carried up well above their
                    natural value, and the operations being
                    largely conducted upon borrowed money, a
                    collapse sooner or later was only to be ex-
                    pected. Indeed, the very properity of the
                    country may have contributed to the depres-
                    sion, as the Egyptian markets are busy at the
                    present moment in financing an excellent crop
                    of cotton, which is commanding a very good
                    price. In all probability the monetary de-
                    amds of genuine business has reduced the
                    amount available for speculation, and shares
                    have perforce been sold. Although the ten-
                    dency in some of these securities is now
                    slightly better, those who follow the course of
                    events in Egypt would not be surpised to see
                    a further decline.</p>

                    <p>The annual blue books of statistics of the
                    trade of Spain for 1904 recently issued state
                    that the imports into Spain from Egypt
                    amounted during the year to £464,364, and
                    Egypt received exports from Spain to the
                    value of £4,326. On the whole British imports
                    in Spain showed a falling off £451,174, whilst
                    the imports of our Colonies and dependen-

                        <p>The triumphal progress of the Railway
                        Institute football team received a check at
                        Ghezireh Badrane on Friday, when in a fair
                        and square struggle with G. Co., K.R.R.,
                        they were beaten by 2 to 1. The railway men
                        last the toes and attacked Embabeh end. In
                        the early stages of the game G. Co.'s left
                        wing registered a goal, before the home de-
                        fence had known what was happening. A few
                        minutes later a second goal was scored and
                        this quite demoralised the home players, for
                        all through the first half they could do nothing
                        right. After the change of ends the railway
                        men began attacking and kept it up all 
                        through the second half. When well into the
                        last half of the game, Hayes scored the only
                        Institute goal after and exciting scramble in
                        front of the visitors' goal. The home forwards
                        tried hard to put matters straight, but G. Co.
                        won the match by their superiority in the
                        middle line of defence. Mr. Trotter was the
                        referee.</p>
