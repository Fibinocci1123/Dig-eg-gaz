                    <head>RUSSIA TO-DAY.</head>
                    <p>What has happened in Russia, what it
                        happening, and what is likely to happen
                        form the components of a problem. The
                        sudden resolution of any constituent elements,
                        like the subsidence of some huge structure
                        of masonry, must always be accompanied
                        by a vast amount of destruction through
                        the mutual concussion of its various parts.
                        What we are witnessing in Russia at the
                        present moment is not so much revolution,
                        <cb n="4"/>
                        which implies arms and a leader, as the violent
                        disintigration of an impossible union of anta-
                        gonistic and ill-assorted materials.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, we have had bloody massacres
                        and even battles in which people, bureaucratic
                        agents, intellectuals, industrials, revolutionists,
                        sailors, soldiers, socialists have been engaged in
                        almost indiscriminate destruction, inspired,
                        amidst the sudden strophy of centralised
                        government, either by predatory lust or by an
                        anthusiasm for the particular social or religious
                        theory they have adopted and made their own.
                        And, remmeber, there is not in the wide world
                        a more fanatical theorist than the half-educa-
                        ted Russian. There would be a better prospect
                        of the emergence of a Liberal Constitution if
                        the various elements of disorder were in rough
                        and ready agreement with one another. When,
                        however, the political and economic machinery
                        of the empire was suddenly put out of gear, the
                        shock threw every one off their mental and
                        moral balance, and while the Government
                        cannot cope forcibly with the new tactics of
                        the revolutionaries, and re-establish the status
                        quo by arms, there is not sufficient revolu-
                        tionary cohesion for an encounter, corps a corps,
                        with the still concrete fact of bureaucratic
                        reaction.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless so much has been gained that
                        a fire has been kindled which, although it
                        may smolder, can never be put out. The
                        revolution has discovered a power before which
                        all the force of Tsardom is important. And
                        even should chaotic extravagance of thought
                        and action and lack of cohesion conduce to a
                        temporary check of the Liberal movement and
                        the withdrawal or nullification of the privileges
                        obtained, it has amply proved the temper of
                        its weapons, and can look with confidence to
                        the future.</p>
                    <p>Now, it is precisely for this smouldering of
                        the fire that the bureaucratic power has been
                        watching and waiting, trusting for ultimate
                        salvation to the stomach to drive the revolu-
                        tionary spirit of the great strike movement
                        back to the paths of subordination and wage-
                        earning labour.</p>
                    <p>In the forefront of bureaucratic oppression,
                        the influence which, like a heavy stone impos-
                        ed upon grass, has for many generations dwarf-
                        ed and stunted the moral and material deve-
                        lopment of the Russian people, has been the
                        foreign ambition of their masters. In the inte-
                        rests of these they have been sacrificed, rob-
                        bed bled; and the prospects of genuine reform
                        are inseperably bound up with the inaugura-
                        tion of a moderate, unambitious, and economic
                        foreign policy which, on the basis of good rela-
                        tions with all, will permit the fullest concen-
                        tration of national energy on the moral and
                        economic regeneration of the race. What is
                        happening in Russia to-day is no more than a
                        reflection of what took place in this land of
                        Egypt several thousand years ago; and the
                        Pharaoh of the Neva will prove as obdurate of
                        heart as his prototype of the Nile, until, in the
                        fulness of time, the fire- which naught can
                        quench- will burst forth once more, with
                        furious finality.</p>
                    <p>It has been frequently asked whether, and
                        to what extent, the Russian peasantry have
                        been affected by revolutionary teaching and
                        principles. This is a very material question,
                        because until the Russian proletariat is ready
                        to think, speak, and act in unison there
                        can be no revolution, in the fullest sense
                        of the term. At the present day, however,
                        there is no material for a Jacquerie- and if
                        active revolution is to come, and the events
                        of the last few days at Sevastopol look as
                        though it has come with a vengence, it
                        will be brought about by a revolt of the
                        sons of the people in the armies of the Tsar.</p>

                            <p>Things in Russia are undoubtedly going
                                from bad to worse. There are rumours to-day
                                that a great coup d’etat has taken place at
                                St. Petersburg, and large numbers of Cossacks
                                are said to be assembling in the Capital.</p>
                            <p>A great run on the savings banks through-

                                that the attitude of the Government is consi-

                                the revolutionaries. Financial and commercial
                                circles are aghast. There was a further heavy
                                drop in prices both at St. Petersburg and at
                                Moscow yesterday. It is openly declared in the

                            <p>When the garrison of Fort Peter and Paul
                                assembled for roll call, the artillery demanded
                                the immediate release of the electrical students
                                arrested on the 29th November. This demand
                                was transmitted to the Commandant of the 
                                fortress, who complied.</p>
                            <p>It is officially confirmed that the loyal troops
                                have captured the barracks occupied by the
                                mutineers at Sevastopol. 2,000 of these with
                                quick-firing guns have surrendered. The cruiser
                                Otchakoff is gutted, but is still floating. The
                                town is not damaged.</p>
                            <p>A number of Guardsmen have been arrested
                                at Tzarskoe Selo for presenting demands ob-

                            <p>It is rumoured that a Grand Duke partici-
                                pated in a plot against the Tsar. There are

                                of the Guards, but it is impossible to say defi-
                                nitely whether any Grand Duke participated.

                        postponed from Thursday last, took place
                        yesterday at the Mixed Courts, Cairo. At 3.15
                        p.m. <persName>Judge Tuck</persName> opened the proceedings by
                        stating that he had received communications

                        the directors of the Sucreries Company, who
                        criticized the last report of the experts on two
                        grounds-firstly, the though it had been
                        agreed that a copy of the report prepared by

                        therewith, and were in consequence compelled
                        to hear its criticisms in silence, unable to offer
                        a prepared defence. The criticisms of the ex-

                        their attack reached the public, through the

                        defence which the directors would otherwise
                        have been in a position to offer. Secondly, 
                        they protested against the excessive animus
                        that marked the criticisms passed on the
                        administration of the company by the three
                        experts.</p>

                        the three experts found themselves unable to
                        complete it in time to deliver a copy to the

                        took place. The legal representative of the

                        the proposals made under the concordat pre-

                    <head>CAIRO IMPROVEMENTS.
                        THE GHEZIREH BRIDGE.</head>
                    <p>Another new bridge is to be built across the
                        Nile, the Government having decided on the
                        construction of a magnificent structure to
                        unite Boulac and Ghezireh. The work will be
                        taken in hand shortly.</p>
                    <p>The new bridge will be twenty metres in
                        width and will form a most convenient connect-
                        ing link between the centre of Cairo and the
                        fashionable new suburb of Ghezireh by the
                        Boulac avenue. The Ghezireh quarter will thus
                        soon form an integral portion of the Capital,
                        especially as a double line of tramway is to be
                        laid across the river. The Ghezireh end of the
                        bridge will be about two metres to the north of
                        the Ghezireh Palace Hotel and will divide
                        the estate of the Egyptian Hotels Company in
                        two parts.</p>
                    <p>It is obvious that with the universal tend-
                        ency of all great cities-Alexandria being on
                        of the very few exceptions to the general rule-
                        to extend, so far as concerns their fashionable
                        quarters, in a westerly direction, Ghezireh is
                        inevitably destined to become the "Champs
                        Elysees" of the Capital of Egypt. The only
                        drawback to the development of Ghezireh has
                        been its distance from the centre of the city, but
                        this will be now entirely obviated by the new
                        bridge, which will bring it in direct communica-
                        tion with the centre of Cairo.</p>

                        has been formed in London to pen up com-

                    <p>On the evening of Wednesday a grand
                        concert was given by the band from an Austrian
                        first-class cruiser in the little garden adjoining
                        the Eastern Exchange, in aid of the Austrian
                        Benevolent Society of Port Said. The garden
                        was magnificently decorated with flags of all
                        nations. The band played 10 very select pieces
                        and were twice encored. It is hoped that the
                        society will be able to make a few homes com-

                    <p>It appears that on the morning of the 27th
                        November, a telegram from a number of Copts
                        and Europeans reached the moudirieh head-
                        quarters, stating that a number of Muslims had
                        insulted the Christian religion by holding a
                        mock funeral, imitating the officiating priest
                        and cross-bearer.</p>
                    <p>On enquiries being made it proved that
                        seven men of the lowest class had insulted both
                        Christian and Muslim religions. On the morn-
                        ing of the 27th they entered the El Adawi-
                        mosque, interrupted prayers, and created a
                        great disturbance. After leaving the mosque
                        they indulged in a travesty of a Christian
                        funeral, and having insulted both religions
                        found themselves pursued by the police.</p>
                    <p>five have been arrested and have confessed
                        their guilt. The remaining members of the

                    <p>The meeting of the Railway Institute F.C.
                        and F. Co. of the K.R.R. on Tuesday, proved to
                        be a capital game. The slight rain which fell in
                        the forenoon had no effect on the ground,- if
                        anything it improved it. The railway men's
                        full team turned out to opposed their antagon-
                        ists. From the very start off and all through
                        the first half the home team were the superior
                        XI., and they were continually attacking the
                        visitors' custodian. The consequence was, that
                        when the first half terminated, the railway
                        men had 5 goals to their credit. In the second
                        half F. Co. struggled with the desperate energy,
                        and by the 'cute understanding of the left
                        wing pair, managed to score a couple of goals.
                        Thus the Railway Institute were left the
                        victors by 5 goals to 2. Mr. Allport was the
                        referee.</p>

                    <docAuthor>By Sir Handury Brown, K.C.M.G., late Inspector-General of
                    Irrigation in Lower Egypt, and formly in Upper Egypt.</docAuthor>
                    <head>VI.</head>
                    <p>The preceding articles have dealt with the
                    considerations which affect the designing of a
                    canal projet. After the designing comes con-
                    struction, and after construction the use of
                    the works to serve the end for which they
                    were designed and constructed. To one class
                    of engineers the construction period is the
                    only one that is interesting; and, no doubt,
                    the satisfaction of seeing an important
                    work grown under one's hands is a solid one.
                    Moreover, the "gallery" applauds, and
                    honors are distributed when a work of suffi-
                    cient importance to attract the attention of
                    the public is successfully brough to a comple-
                    tion; and there is satisfaction also in that,
                    though not so solic. All the world, for instance,
                    has heard of the Assonouan dam, though many
                    have very inaccurate ideas as to whom should
                    be given the credit of the original conception of
                    the design and of the actual construction. But
                    the dam is there, whoever fathered it, and it is
                    doing its duty , regarding which little will be
                    known by any but those who are specially in-
                    terested in Egypt and watch its further develop-
                    ment. Fortunate, indeed, is the engineer whose
                    duties comprehend the work of each of the three
                    period of design, construction and administra-
                    tion, and who has the satisfaction of converting
                    his design into material structures, and of
                    using them to produce prosperity among the
                    people for whose benefit they were designed.</p>
                    <p>Already, in the first article, a list has been
                    given of the different descriptions of works
                    that an irrigation engineer has to design, con-
                    struct and utilise. They are many and various.
                    The ordinary principles and methods of con-
                    struction apply to most of them. But from
                    among them there may be selected as belonging
                    peculiarly to the province of the irrigation
                    engineer such masonry works as high dams to
                    create storage reservoirs, anicuts and barrages
                    to raise the summer level of rivers, canal head-
                    works to control the main supply; also syphons,
                    aqueducts, super-passages, to carry one
                    watercourse past another; and lastly navigation
                    locks. Most of these would have their founda-
                    tion level below the lowest water level, and
                    would present more or less difficulty of con-
                    struction according to the nature of the
                    foundation bed and the strength of springs
                    over the foundation area. The ordinary method
                    of getting in the foundations is to surround the
                    area of operations by banks to exclude the
                    outside water, and to get rid of the inside
                    water by pumping. The concrete is then laid,
                    so to speak, "in the dry," an expression not
                    to be understood literally, as where springs are
                    working the conrete may have to be laid in
                    about a foot of water. This was the method of
                    construction adopted in the case of the Assiout
                    barrage, lately built in Upper Egypt simultane-
                    ously with the Assouan dam. The advantage of
                    this method over others is that all the work
                    done is in sight at the time of execution. But
                    it has this disadvantage- that, unless the
                    springs are intelligently and skilfully treated
                    defects in the floor will be created by the water
                    forcing its way either under or through the
                    floor. It happens sometimes that the super-
                    vising staff has not the experience necessary
                    for successfully dealing with the springs, but
                    gains it as the work proceeds, so that the first
                    season's work is not without its mistakes. The
                    principle to be observed in dealing with springs
                    is that no attempt should be made to stop
                    them working until they have been surrounded
                    on all sides by masonry of sufficient strength
                    to resisit the efforts of the spring to find a
                    new outlet through it. If the cement concrete,
                    which forms the bottom layer of the foundation
                    platform, is advanced from one extremity of
                    the work in an even line towards the other,
                    the springs will form runs for themselves
                    through the unset edge of the concrete layer.
                    And, as it advances, more and more springs
                    will assert themselves in the same way, until
                    there is a strong outflow along the advancing
                    edge of the concrete, due to the combined
                    action of all the springs, except such as have
                    forced their way sideways to the margins of
                    the concrete layer; where they will continue
                    to work. The cementing material of the con-
                    crete will thus be washed away as soon as it is laid
                    and runs will thus be formed under and through the
                    foundation platform, which will give trouble
                    afterwards. The way to avoid this is carefully
                    to locate all springs, and, as the concrete
                    advances, to carry it all round them, but not
                    over them. As the springs will continue to work,
                    their water must be led away in pipes, or chan-
                    nels al set masonry, over or through the con-
                    crete layers, until they are completely surroun-
                    ded by masonry too strong for them to burst
                    through. They can then be forcibly stopped
                    with safety, and they will be powerless to work
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    harm. The methods of dealing with springs vary
                    in detail with the ingenuity of those in charge
                    of the work, but the guiding principle is the
                    same with all, namely to attempt no violence
                    to the spring till sufficient forces are marshalled
                    all round it to compel submission.</p>
                    <p>The disadvantages of putting in foundations
                    with strong springs in action over the founda-
                    tion bed have caused other methods to be
                    resorted to. In India the method of getting in
                    foundations by well-sinking is in favor, and has
                    repeatedly been employed with much success.
                    Circular or rectangular wells are built on well-
                    curbs which rest on the sand at the natural
                    water-level, or at the level to which it may be
                    judged convenient to lower the water by
                    pumping. The wells are weighted, and the
                    sand excavated from within by special plant,
                    so that the wells sink below water level as
                    the excavation continues. More height is
                    added to them and teh sinking is conti-
                    nued till the bottom of the well has reached
                    the required depth. The superstructure is
                    afterwards built on a platform covering the
                    wells.</p>
                    <p>There is also the method of getting in
                    foundations by the help of compressed air.
                    which, however, has not been much used in
                    irrigation work in India or Egypt. It requires
                    special plant and labour skilled in the pro-
                    cess, as there are dangers attending its em-
                    polyment by untrained hands.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Prinzing, of Berlin, denies that the
                    number of bachelors and old maids is increas-
                    ing in Europe. As a matter of fact, says the

                    is decreasing only in Sweden, France, and
                    Ireland. In Germany the number of bachelors
                    steadily decreases, and only in certain limited
                    areas can any increase of old maids be found.</p>

                    <p>Monte Carlo has just put in force a most
                    important scheme to tax all foreigners engaged
                    in business in the principality. A large num-
                    ber of licences granted during the summer are
                    being held back. If the new rule is made
                    retrospective it will affect all English limited
                    liability companies, besides a large number of
                    English, French, Italian, and German mer-
                    chants and shopkeepers. Villa holders may
                    also be liable to taxation.</p>

                    <p>Pe-ru-na, Used as a last resort, cured her of
                    a severe attack of Catarrh of the lungs.</p>
                    <p>The sensational care of Mrs.
                    Caldwell is the talk of her
                    acquaintances.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Ida Caldwell, 506 Pearl street,
                    Sioux City, Ia., Vice-President Order of
                    Washington, writes:</p>
                    <p>"I suffered with catarrh of the res-
                    piratory organs off and on for the last
                    three years until I thought it was
                    chronic. My chest and lungs were ir-
                    ritated and I had to use the greatest
                    care not to expose myself to chilly air
                    or dampness as it increased my troubles.</p>
                    <p>"My physician advised me to try a
                    change of climate, but I was unable to
                    leave my family. Reading of the won-
                    derful cures performed by Peruns, I
                    bought a bottle.</p>
                    <p>"It was with the greatest satisfaction
                    that I found it the one medicine among
                    them all which cured me. I was re-
                    lieved within three days and after two
                    months and a half the irritation was
                    gone, my lungs perfectly healed and my
                    health restored." -Ida Caldwell.</p>
                    <p>Thousands of women owe their lives
                    to Peruna. Hundreds of thousands owe
                    their health to Peruna. Hundreds of
                    thousands are praising Peruna in every
                    state of the Union.</p>
                    <p>We have many thousands of letters
                    from grateful women, with permission
                    to use them in public print, which can
                    never be used for want of space.</p>
                    <p>Catarrh would not be such a curse
                    in this country if the people thuroughly
                    understand its nature. It must be
                    treated at once to prevent it from mak-
                    ing inroads upon vital organs.</p>
                    <p>If you suffer from catarrh, buy Pe-
                    runa to-day, for a day gained on the
                    enemy, catarrh, means a day nearer
                    recovery.</p>

                    monials like the one given here. We can

                    volume of enthusiastic letters of thanks
