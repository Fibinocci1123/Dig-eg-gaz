                    <head>GERMANY AND THE NAVY.</head>
                    <p>The German papers do not hesitate to con-
                        sider (say Reuter to-day) that the Emperor
                        William's words in his speech at the opening
                        of the Reichstag were aimed at Great Britain
                        and France. It is, unfortunately, a fixed idea
                        with a considerable proportion of the German
                        people, and especially with those who have
                        taken to heart their Kaiser's declaration that
                        the future of Germany lies upon the water,
                        that England means to destroy the German
                        Fleet before it has become too powerful. Any
                        man who seriously belives that England would
                        ever enter upon a war of aggression for that end
                        is profoundly ignorant of the temper of the
                        British nation. We desire peace with all the
                        world, and with Germany at least as much as
                        with any other Power, for this simple reason-
                        that, apart from the temporary set-back to her
                        commercial activity, Germahy would have 'no'
                        spoils to surrender to a victorious England.
                        The game, in short, would not be worth the
                        candle, because Germany posesses nothing
                        that we could take from her which would be
                        worth the taking. But has England nothing
                        that Germany envies, nothing would be a
                        rish prize for her? The question, surely, an-
                        swers itself. There is the British Empire, which,
                        as German Professors are never weary to tell-
                        ing us, is bound, sooner or later, to go the way
                        of all other Empires in history. "This is the
                        heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance
                        shall be ours." That, briefly, is the view of
                        that section of German opinion, official and
                        unofficial, which is responsible for the growth
                        of the German Navy. If any one doubt that,
                        let him recall the attitude of the German
                        Press and public towards England during the
                        Boer War. Nay, the actual preamble of the
                        Navy Act of 1900 proves that the increase of
                        the German Navy is specially directed against
                        England. It says:- "Germany must have a
                        fleet of such strength that a war against the
                        mightiest Power would involve risks threaten-
                        ing the supremacy of that Power." In the
                        face of that declaration, and of the plain
                        teaching of German and Prussian policy in the
                        past, it is the obvious duty of the British
                        Government so to order the distribution of the
                        British Navy as to be prepared for all contin-
                        gencies. That does not mean that we ought to,
                        or that we shall, attack Germany for the deli-
                        berate purpose of destroying her fleet before it
                        becomes too strong; but it does mean that we
                        shall take care that she shall not serve us as
                        she served Austria in 1866 and France in 1870.
                        If Germany distructs our intentions is it
                        because she is concious that we have good
                        reason to distruct hers. She knows- she must
                        known- that we cannot choose but regard her
                        with suspicion, because she herself, for years
                        past, has made no secret of her belief that she
                        is pre-destined to be the World Power of the
                        Twentiath Century as England has been of the
                        Nineteenth.</p>

                        ACTION AGAINST THE KHEDIVE.</head>
                    <p>Sherriff Davidson in Glasgow issued an im-
                        portant judgment on the 21st inst., in an action
                        against the Khedive, who was sued for £2,000
                        by Mr. A. M. Gordon, naval architect and
                        engineer, of Baltic Chamberg Wellington-street,
                        Glasgow.</p>
                    <p>The action concerns the Khedive's steam
                        yacht Mahrousse, the plaintiff averring that he
                        was employed by the defendant in connection
                        with certain alterations to be made on the
                        yacht, and that he was to be paid £2,000 for
                        preparing plans and seeing the work carried
                        through.</p>
                    <p>Defendant states there were certain dealings
                        between plaintif and the captain of the yacht,
                        but he denied that plaintiff was employed to
                        do the work.</p>
                    <p>An interesting point in connection with the
                        case was that the yacht was arrested in the
                        yard of Messrs. Inglis, Pointhouse, Glasgow.</p>
                    <p>Plaintiss submitted an application asking
                        the court to apply to the Secretary of State for
                        Foreign Affairs for a certificate to the effect
                        that his Highness the Khedive was not an
                        independent Sovereign, and was, therefore,
                        subject to the jurisdiction of the court.</p>
                    <p>The Sheriff refused this application, but
                        closed the record, and allowed a proof as to
                        plaintiff's averment that he has arrested the
                        property of the defendant to find jurisdiction.</p>

                        ANGLO-EGYPTIAN MEEETING.</head>
                    <p>The nineteenth ordinary general meeting of
                        the Englo-Egyptian Bank (limited) was held
                        yesterday week at 27, Clement's lane, E.C.,
                        Mr. Thomas Usborne presiding.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said the total net profit
                        exceeding £100,000. Although that constituted
                        a record, he warned the shareholders that
                        those records could not go on forever. For the
                        last fifteen years or so banking in Egypt had
                        been few, and no bad debts whatever had been
                        made on loans secured by Egyptian real pro-
                        perty. It was almost difficult to make bad debts
                        in a country where the land and other real
                        property were always rising in value and the
                        bulk of the people were getting daily richer,
                        but that position of affairs would reach its
                        zenith one day, and although he would not
                        have them attach too much importance to his
                        opinion, he though the zenith had been reach-
                        ed, and that the value of property was now too
                        high. There were now ten banks, the majority
                        of them important, at work in Egypt, and the
                        directors heard of another- an English one-
                        the prospectus of which would be issued very
                        shortly. The reserve fund was equal to the
                        paid-up capital, £500,000, there were other
                        small reserve funds amounting to £40,000,
                        and they were carrying forward £36,000. With
                        the consent of the shareholders the board
                        intended contributing £50,000 to a proposed
                        pension fund, and to add to it each year until
                        it amounted to £100,000, when they expected
                        the interest would meet the pensions. He
                        concluded by moving the adoption of the
                        report, which was seconded by Mr. H.A.
                        Richardson, and carried unanimously.</p>

                    <p>In the London Bankruptcy Court this day
                        week, before Mr. E.S. Grey, Official Receiver,
                        the first meeting of creditors was held
                        under the failure of Shrager Bros., merchants,
                        of 4 Lloyd's avennue, E.C.</p>
                    <p>The chairman repoted that the firm had
                        carried on business at Calcutta, Colombo,
                        Singapore, Alexandria, and Broome, West
                        Australia. The business was established in
                        1888 and the turnover had amounted to three
                        of four millions of pounds a year. Proofs
                        amounting to £57,809 had been sent in, but he
                        (the Official Receiver) was unable to state the
                        exact amount of the indebtedness or assets
                        until accounts had been received from the
                        various foreign branches of the business. The
                        London house acted as buying and selling
                        agents for the other branches, the principal

                        oil, rice, bone-meal, and shellac. The failure
                        was caused by the apparent excellence of this
                        year's jute crop. The London house received
                        large orders from Calcutta to sell for an
                        expected fall in prices; but early in October
                        last, owing to floods in the Goalando district
                        and the disorganisation of railway traffic,
                        Calcutta could not get delivery of jute, and
                        prices rose everywhere. The Official Assignee
                        of Bengal was in possession fo the Indian
                        estate, and it was for the creditors to consider

                        MAN'S BODY FOUND AT GABBARI.</head>
                    <p>Two native women and six girls were
                        engaged in gathering snails on Tuesday after-
                        noon in Gabbari Gardens, when they were
                        horrified to find the dead body of a man lying
                        on the ground. The man had evidently been
                        strangled. His hands were tied behind his
                        back, and a blue silk handkerchief was
                        firmly fastened round his neck.</p>
                    <p>At the sight of the body, one of the girls
                        promptly ran home and informed her brother

                        of age, and a cook by profession. He arrived at

                        of about 30 dollars was found on his body by
                        the police.</p>
                    <p>Several arrests on suspicion have been made,
                        but no definite clue to the crime has been

                        <p>Three days ago four men servants who are
                            employed on the Um Rus were assaulted
                            by a band of robbers as they were taking
                            baggage, papers, etc., laden on four camels, to
                            the mine in the mountains. After a fight
                            the attacking party succeeded in obtaining
                            possession of the property and camels, and
                            the men in charge returned and informed the
                            police of the occurrence.</p>
                        <p>Steps were immediately taken for the arrest
                            of the thieves, and men were stationed at
                            every outlet from the mountain. After two

                            having been killed. Search is going on for a
                            fourth man, who was the leader of the gang.
                            The men in custody will be brought to Keneh
                            to-day, and an enquiry opened in the affair.</p>

                        The programme was replete with excellent and
                        interesting numbers, vocal and instrumental,
                        and the selections from Mozart's 'Requiem"
                        and Wagner's 'Apostle's Supper' were quite
                        surprisingly well given. The Financial Ad-
                        viser's note, which appeared on the after-
                        noon of the concert, was most opportune,
                        and gave great encouragement to the com-
                        mittee, Professor Colella, and his devoted
                        staff of professors, as also to the small
                        band of 50 adherents. There are "better
                        days coming" for the Conservatoire, and all
                        honor is due to those who have manfully
                        stuck to their guns in the days of distress and
                        opposition.</p>

                        <p>We have to chronicle a triplet of First Events.
                            The quiet and peaceful existence at Port
                            Sudan has been broken. We have had a 7,000-
                            ton ship at anchor in our quickly improv-
                            ing harbour, we have actually had a concert,
                            and, miabile dictu, prepared for a real cricket
                            match. It is true that some few days back,
                            we had an epidemic of bruglaries whcih upset
                            the monotony of life somewhat, and the
                            chance of capturing some enterprising burglar
                            sent one to the heated couch, with subdued
                            excitement and apprehension of all sorts of
                            contingencies, but Fielden Bey issued an
                            edict to the effect that after 9 p.m. (or
                            curfew hour) all people out in the highway
                            and byeways were to carry lamps, or suffer
                            such fines and penalties as he, the High
                            Official aforesaid, might impose, and Allah
                            is God, and Kismet is Fate. Lo__ the Faith-
                            ful no longer lose their property, and the
                            Feringhi High or unimportant, can once more
                            sleep the sleep of the hard worked and
                            just. Actually, the very room of the Majesty
                            of law and order (civil and military) was
                            entered, and a whole trunk of kit removed.
                            Luckily, the Inspector woke up, and the
                            enemy fled, pursued by a good six feet six
                            of solid English wrath, not to mention a rear
                            rank of a very angry Bey and sundry other
                            Government officers woken up from their
                            dreams of cool winds or English snows. So,
                            robberies having ceased, the arrival of a band
                            on the S.S. Afghanistan (Capt. Moore) was
                            promptly made use of, and an engagement as
                            promptly followed, and on the evening of the
                            15th inst. Fielded Bey and the members of
                            the engineers' mess at Government House
                            asked for the pleasure of the company of some
                            fifty of the residents, at a concert to be held on
                            that date (carriages at 10.30 p.m. might have
                            been added, but our first cariolet and swarthy
                            Jehu have yet to arrive) and The Residence
                            was very prettily decorated by the aid of
                            many flags known and unknown to students
                            of these national trophies, and kudos goes
                            to Messrs. Barry and Campbell, the artists
                            concerned. The orchestra, which deserves
                            mention, was quite a pleasant surprise, for
                            not only did they tackle a programme of
                            distinct class, but played the numbers with
                            well-drilled ensemble and evident respect to
                            the baton of their chef d'orchestre. Of a long
                            programme, the intermezzo of Cavalleria Rusti-
                            cana was delightfully played and well merited
                            the encore. Due appreciation of difference
                            between forte and piano was shown, and the
                            crescendos were distinctly not only weel done
                            but played with artistic enjoyment; other
                            successes were the rarely heard ballet music
                            from Gounod's Faust, Braga's Serenata (for
                            violincello and piano), an excellent violin
                            solo, and the pretty Salut d'Armour." The
                            concert terminated with the good old British
                            songs "The old Folks at Home" and "The Song
                            that Reached my Heart," arranged by the
                            conductor, the oboe and clarinet taking the
                            solos, and the pizzicato accompaniments being
                            dainty and effective. At the conclusion,
                            Fielden Bey was seen to congratulate Mr.
                            Coke on the work of his men. And they
                            deserved it. The audience of over 50 was
                            enthusiastic, even the placud Mohamedans
                            waking up to applaud each item. I ought to
                            mention that the orchestra is going out to
                            play at Bombay, at the new Taj Mahal Hotel 
                            there- a treat for its patrons.</p>
                        <p>The harbour works are progressing, and in
                            due time the quays will be ready to receive
                            some ten steamers alongside of them. New
                            houses, too, are springing up on all sides,
                            albeit there is no ground tenure as yet. Until
                            we get an hotel, and electric light, we shall
                            nto be happy.</p>
                        <p>A great disappointment occurred on the
                            18th inst. The town had challenged the S.S.
                            Afghanistan to play the first game of cricket
                            ever known here. Every preparation was 
                            made, a nice tent, iced drinks galore, and
                            hospitality in every shape were, at the hands
                            of our Sports Club, conspicuous. At the
                            last moment the captain of our opponents, Mr.
                            Coke, who is an old school and county player,
                            we heard, turned up to say that the ship was
                            due to sail at mid-day. The law of a ship
                            captain is like unto that of the Medes and
                            Persians, so we could but stand the musical
                            cricketer a cold doch an dorris and wish him
                            every luck in the Farther East.</p>
                        <p>A new firm has arrived, but this time it is
                            not a Greek one. The new arrival, Mr. Warren,
                            is an experienced African traveller, and he is a
                            genial fellow and full of anecdote, who should
                            cut out some of the Greek merchants. We
                            have room for more english commerical enter-
                            prise. I ought to add that as there are some
                            300 out-of-works- all Greeks or Italians- no
                            one can land and stay here without a passport.</p>
