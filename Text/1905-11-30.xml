                            Awad, secretary to the Wakfs' counsel, Alex-
                            andria, comprising a historical survey of the
                            dowry and some of its regulations and terms
                            in the old Greek and Roman time, and its
                            modern rules under French law, supplemented

                            the following remarks: "Young people can be
                            seen everywhere seeking their fortunes through
                            marriage, and many people prefer to remain
                            bachelors with bright hopes of obtaining for-
                            tunes of dowries, rather than marry a poor
                            or little-moneyed girl, albeit she is pretty,
                            polite, and well-educated. The young man
                            who, in the course of searching for his better
                            half, finds a beautiful, well-dowered, refined,
                            and agreeable wife is one of the happiest of

                    <head>THE YACHT MAHROUSSA.
                    ACTION AGAINST THE KHEDIVE.</head>
                    <p>Sherriff Davidson in Glasgow issued an im-
                        portant judgment on the 21st inst., in an action
                        against the Khedive, who was sued for £2,000
                        by Mr. A. M. Gordon, naval architect and
                        engineer, of Baltic Chamberg Wellington-street,
                        Glasgow.</p>
                    <p>The action concerns the Khedive's steam
                        yacht Mahrousse, the plaintiff averring that he
                        was employed by the defendant in connection
                        with certain alterations to be made on the
                        yacht, and that he was to be paid £2,000 for
                        preparing plans and seeing the work carried
                        through.</p>
                    <p>Defendant states there were certain dealings
                        between plaintif and the captain of the yacht,
                        but he denied that plaintiff was employed to
                        do the work.</p>
                    <p>An interesting point in connection with the
                        case was that the yacht was arrested in the
                        yard of Messrs. Inglis, Pointhouse, Glasgow.</p>
                    <p>Plaintiss submitted an application asking
                        the court to apply to the Secretary of State for
                        Foreign Affairs for a certificate to the effect
                        that his Highness the Khedive was not an
                        independent Sovereign, and was, therefore,
                        subject to the jurisdiction of the court.</p>
                    <p>The Sheriff refused this application, but
                        closed the record, and allowed a proof as to
                        plaintiff's averment that he has arrested the
                        property of the defendant to find jurisdiction.</p>

                        just issued the range of their activites.
                        Accompanying the report are documents deal-
                        ing exhaustively with the claims made by the
                        next-of-kin of his late Highness Ismail Khedive
                        of Egypt against the Egyptian Government,
                        including the joint opinion of Messrs. Asquith,
                        Upjohn, and Nepean, to the effect "that the
                        claims of the heirs of his Highness Ismail
                        Pasha rest upon an equitable basis, and ought
                        to be enforceable in a Court of Justice." It
                        will be remembered that the claim is for six
                        and a half millions, and that the defendants
                        are the Egyptian Government, the Daira

                        held at Cannon-street Hotel, London, last week,
                        Lord Hillingdon presiding. The chairman
                        referred to a letter he had received from
                        the Sirdar, Sir R. Wingate, strongly advocat-
                        ing the appointment of three additional
