      <head>NAVAL BATTLE AT SEVASTOPOL.
      HALF CITY DEMOLISHED,
      MUTINY AT LIBAU</head>

        <head>St. Petersburg, November 30.</head>
          <p>The "Slovo” states that a naval battle took
          place on Tuesday at Sevastopol. It lasted two
          hours. The rebel ships opened fire on the forts.
          The cruiser Otchakoff was pierced and burst
          into flames; the cruiser Dnieper, another ship,
          and several torpedo-boats were sunk. Lieutenant
          Schmidt, chief of the rebels, having been
          killed, the squadron surrendered. Half the city
          of Sevastopol is demolished.</p>
          <p>A grave mutiny has broken out at Liban,
          and another is feared at Kronstadt. (Reuter)</p>

        <p>Another account of the battle at Sevastopol
        is that the mutineers lost heart when a rebel
        torpedo-boat was sunk and two cruisers
        damaged. They endeavoured to make the shore
        in boats, but were intercepted by the loyal
        torpedo-boats. Meanwhile; the loyal Bielostock
        Regiment attacked the barracks held by the
        mutinous seamen, 1,500 of whom surrendered
        with 10 Maxims, owing to the attitude of the
        Naval Battalions.</p>
        <p>Disarmed reservists are parading the streets
        at Nijni Novgorod singing revolutionary
        songs.</p>
        <p>Reservists at Doinsk have unanimously
        resolved not to take the oath if called out.
        The resolution has been printed and distributed
        broadcast.</p>
        <p>110.000 men are either locked out or on
        strike here, and 58,700 at Moscow. (Reuter)</p>

        <p>There has been a battle between the rebels
        and the Royalist troops. Half of the city
        is destroyed. The mutineers were defeated
        and surrendered. Lieutenant Schmidt is
        fatally wounded.	(Havas)</p>

      which will undertake business in American
      and Egyptian cotton on the markets of New
      York and Liverpool and also in the stocks and

      exchange. The market has expected 8,000,000
      bales of cotton to be ginned up to Nov. 14,
      there were only 7,498,167 bales. There was
      a mad rush to buy; prices went up 20 points
      at a time. Then Mr. Hoadley turned seller.
      His total profits on the day's business are
      estimated at £800,000.</p>
      <head>Post Office Notice.</head>
      <p>Owing to the fact that former notices
      referring to clear direction of correspondence
      have been largely disregarded by the public
      and that the general delivery has had to be
      delayed in consequence, it has been decided
      that from 1st February 1906, correspondence
      for house to house delivery addressed only
      "Cairo" or "Alexandria" will be retarded and
      only sorted after the first delivery of each
      mail has left the post offices in those towns.
      After that date it will be no longer necessary
      to make special requests for house to house
      delivery as correspondence bearing the full

      <head>MR. CHAMBERLAIN AND THE OCTROI.</head>
      <p>Mr. Cooke, secretary of the Cheshire Liberal

      Chamberlain’s attention to the fact that the
      removal of the octroi duties in Cairo made
      provisions dearer, proving Protection often
      cheapens and Free Trade raises prices to the
      consumer. Mr. Cooke also urged that the
      navigation laws required amendment. In his
      reply to Mr. Cooke, Mr. Chamberlain said
      he was in Cairo last year and could confirm
      the statement as to the effect of the octroi.
      He was also aware of the effect of the one-
      sided navigation laws, which undoubtedly
      tended to the disadvantage of British shipping

      <head>THE GHIZEH ACCIDENT
      SYPHON WRECKED.</head>
      <p>It now appears that the total length of bank
      that collapsed between Ghizeh and Hawamdieh
      did not exceed 20 metres. The basin, which
      most have contained some 230,000,000 cubic
      metres of water, has been emptying itself into
      the Nile, carrying away some minor irrigation
      works and wrecking the syphon under the
      Ghizeh Canal.</p>
      <p>A report was circulated in Cairo yesterday
      evening that the foundations of the masonry
      work of the bridge showed signs of having
      sustained some damage, threatening to prolong
      the delay to traffic with Upper Egypt.</p>
      <p>The rumour arose from the fact that the
      earth fillings of the approaches to the bridge
      had given way. The Railway Administration
      is in consequence laying rails across an iron
      bridge close to the old wooden bridge which

      <p>The Constantinople correspondent of the

      Mr. MacGillivray left amid the farewells of a
      great number of friends who had come to the
      station to see him off. Sir Elwin Palmer, who was
      also at the station, presided over a banquet given
      in Mr. MacGillivray's honor on Wednesday
      night, at which he proposed the health of the

      terms to his character and abilities. Some
      twenty of Mr. MacGillivray's friends were
      present on the occasion, and he was the
      recipient of numerous wishes for his safety and
      success in his new post.</p>
      <p>On his departure Mr. MacGillivray was

      <head>GERMAN TRADE WITH EGYPT.</head>
      <p>A Consular report just published in Berlin
      shows a continued large increase of German
      trade with Egypt. In the ten years to 1904
      the exports from Germany to Egypt have
      increased by £750,000, the totals being £350,000
      in 1894 and £1,100,000 in 1904.</p>
      <p>The German coal depots, established at Port
      Said to compete with the British coal depots,
      are doing a large trade, and are extremely
      prosperous. The export of German coal to
      Egypt reached a total of 63,000 tons last year.</p>
      <p>During 1904 seventy German ships, of an
      aggregate tonnage of 150,000, touched at
      Alexandria. The Hamburg-Amerika Line is
      starting a steamship service to the Nile, by
      means of which it is expected that German
      trade with the interior will be considerably
      increased. German trade in Egypt is carried on
      by a German colony of 1,300 persons, of whom
      600 live at Alexandria, and 500 in Cairo.</p>

      <head>TWO RECENT WORKS UPON
      EGYPTIAN NUMISMATICS.</head>
      <p>M. George Dattari, of Cairo, whose cabinet of
      coins is so celebrated among numismatists, has
      recently presented a paper to the Antiquarian
      and Nomismatic Society of Montreal, Canada
      referring to the celebrated statue of Serapis,
      by Bryaxis. The raison d'etre of this monograph
      is the deciding of the date of the statue’s
      arrival at Alexandria, which M. Dattari
      succeeds in achieving by means of evidence derived
      from coins the effigies upon which be
      considers completely settle the question. When
      the essay is printed in extenso, we hope to be
      permitted to publish a oomplete summary of
      its contents.</p>
      <p>Another and longer treatise of M. Dattari
      may be found in that most excellent work the
      “Journal International d’Archeologie
      Numismatique" of Athens. It contains the learned
      author’s comments upon a board of Athenian
      tetradrachms found in Egypt. The thesis is
      as follows. The Saitic dynasty to secure Egyptian
      independence hired Greek mercenaries and
      the Mendesian dynasty to oppose the Persians
      went further, concluding an alliance with
      Macedonia and Athens. From this period Macedonian
      and Athenian coins are common in
      Egypt Tachos of the 30th dynasty employed
      90,000 Greek troops, and to pay the expense
      of his Persian war he ordered his subject's to
      deposit all their gold and silver in the Treasury.</p>
      <p>From his time Athenian tetradrachms are
      plentiful, but they are in most cases of very
      inferior workmanship compared to the splendid
      specimens of Athenian coinage. Athens at
      this time was wealthy and powerful and her
      coinage practically international in the Greek
      world. M. Dietary argues from the coins that
      Tachos struck “Athenian" tetradrachms here,
      and absolutely proves his case by producing
      a photograph of the die employed, which
      was found in Egypt with the hoard of
      tetradrachms, which are beautifully illustrated in
      prototype plates accompanying the essay.
      M. Dattari thinks Egypt imitated other Greek
      coins, but reserves his remarks upon this for
      another occasion.</p>
