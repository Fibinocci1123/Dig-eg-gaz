		<head>SIR W. WILLCOCKS' SCHEME
		AND
		THE BAGDAD RAILWAY.
		GERMAN OPINION.</head>
		<p>The significance and details of Sir William
		Willcocks’ scheme for reconstructing the an-
		cient system of irrigation works in Mesopota-
		mia were discussed on Friday week at Berlin
		at an important meeting of the German Asiati
		Society. Dr. Wiedemann suggested that a rail
		way should be built without farther delay from
		Basra to Bagdad. No useful purpose, he argued:
		could possibly by served by postponing work
		on that section, which would open up to
		cultivation the most fruitful part of Mesopo-
		tamia, until after the completion of the
		railway connecting Bagdad with the north.</p>
		<p>Here Rashdau, of the German Diplomatic
		Service, observed that Dr. Wiedemann’s pro-
		posal had already been considered. It was
		abandoned in deference to the interests of
		Turkey, which required that the railway
		should be built from north to south in order
		that the mobilisation of its troops might
		be accelerated, and also to furnish the Con-
		stantinople authorities with the means of en-
		forcing obedience on the Kurds.</p>
		<p>He warned his hearers not to cherish op-
		timistic views regarding the speedy prolonga-
		tion of the railway. The country traversed
		hitherto was of a comparatively easy character,
		but the next sections offered great engineer-
		ing difficulties, quite apart from the disor-
		dered state of their administration. Who, he
		asked, was to provide the money required
		for the continuation of the enterprise ? Tur-
		key could not, because the foreign Powers,
		and particularly Great Britain, had been ren-
		dered suspicious by the fantastic political
		views imprudently aired by German writers,
		and had refused to assent to any increase
		in the Turkish Customs, with the object of
		producing the requisite revenue.</p>
		<p>Herr Rashdan also urged that German
		manufacturers, merchants, and architects should
		now employ their time in creating large
		German interests and values in Mesopotamia.</p>
		<p>Dr. Vosberg Reckow observed that the main
		significance of the Bagdad Railway for Ger-
		many's oversea policy must consist in the
		circumstance that it would provide a new
		highway to Asia, and thus be of political
		importance to the whole world. It would
		be quite easy, he said, to block the Suez
		Canal for a considerable time. Moreover, the
		Suez Canal was in control of the British, and
		it was absolutely necessary that another over-
		land and oversea route should be opened to
		Asia.</p>
		<p>Dr. Wiedemann did not agree with the argu-
		ment that the Bagdad Railway would be of
		vast importance as a means of communication
		with Asia. The Siberian Railway he remarked,
		had not acquired the importance with which
		anticipation had invested it as a means of pro-
		moting international traffic in goods. It had
		merely exercised a certain effect on passenger
		traffic to the Far East, by compelling compa-
		nies to reduce their tariffs. The Bagdad Rail-
		way, except in times of war, would fulfil its
		chief function in fostering communication be-
		tween the interior and the coasts. A railway
		joining Basra with Bagdad would be a most
		profitable undertaking, for it would give an
		immense impetus to the culture of cotton.</p>
		<p>Professor Otto Warburg, whose botanical
		studies in the tropics have earned for him an
		international reputation, argued that the Bag-
		dad Railway would be of incalculable value
		economically, and especially for the European
		cotton industries. He  observed that the hopes
		cherished in Germany of cultivating sufficient
		cotton for the needs of the Empire in Africa
		were illusory. The one country which was
		suited for the growth of cotton was Mesopo-
		tamia, and the northern portion of Syria.
		The realisation of Sir William Willcocks's
		project would open up, at an expense of
		twenty millions stoning, two millions of
		hectares to cultivation, but there were at
		least two more millions of hectares in those
		regions where artificial irrigation would be
		unnecessary, and where cotton was already
		grown in small quantities. A German company
		had achieved very good results in the south of
		Asia Minor.</p>
		<p>Professor Warburg suggested that in-
		ternational colonisation society should be
		formed to acquire certain rights of adminis-
		tration and jurisdiction in the territories to be
		traversed by the Bagdad Railway, and to
		colonise those territories with a labouring
		population numerous enough to render practic-
		able the cultivation of cotton on a large scale.
		If such a society could be formed it would be
		comparatively an easy matter to find the
		money necessary for the reconstruction of the
		ancient system of canals, and for assisting
		settlers to attain economical prosperity. “In
		this way alone,” concluded Professor Warburg,
		"will it be possible for European cotton in-
		dustries to liberate themselves from the
		tyranny of America. The problem is one that
		affects the entire European Continent, and it
		must be solved, unless Europe is prepared to
		abandon its cotton industries."</p>

		<head>MEDICAL DISEASES OF EGYPT</head>
		<p>The first volume of Dr. Sandwith's work,
		published by Henry Kimpton, London, deals
		mainly with infectious diseases. The value of
		the work is greatly increased by the free
		expression of personal opinion given by the
		author, which, in view of Dr. Sandwith's many
		years of Egyptian experience, renders the book
		invaluable' to “Egyptian students of medicine
		—and newly appointed English doctors—with-
		out any knowledge of what sort of diseases
		they are likely to meet among natives.” At the
		same time the author has taken great trouble
		over his references, a list of which is given
		after each disease, and has endeavoured suc-
		cessfully, we think to put before his readers a
		compendium of the knowledge and the various
		views on the diseases of Egypt.</p>
		<p>The book is well printed and the articles on
		the various diseases are easy and pleasant
		reading. Occasionally we come across an opi-
		nion with which we are not in agreement, as
		for instance in the article on enteric fever
		(page 71), where the author states: "the pangs
		of hunger are only felt by those convalescents
		who have undergone a mild case, for after a
		long bout of fever the individual is too
		exhausted to be hungry.” Our own personal
		experience is distinctly contrary to this. On
		page 114, in his article on infectious jaundice,
		Dr. Sandwith passes a formidable sentence on
		our great port town : "the drains of Alexan-
		dria, constructed before the English Occupa-
		tion by ignorant engineers, remain a disgrace
		to that prosperous city, and when they are
		thoroughly reformed and house sanitation
		taken in hand infectious jaundice will prob-
		ably disappear.” Errors are few—on page 125
		we notice in lines 8 and 9 a statement about
		the British army of which the sense is not clear.</p>
		<p>We notice in  page 152 a most excellent
		table giving the differential diagnosis of in-
		fluenza and dengue. This table should be most
		useful, as all practitioners know the difficulty
		sometimes experience in arriving at a certain
		opinion in such doubtful cases. Two of the
		most interesting articles in this volume are on
		plague and pellagra. The historical and prac-
		tical article on plague occupies 59 pages and
		has over 40 references given of the measures adopted in
		Egypt for dealing with this disease. The arti-
		cle on pellagra is excellent. It is a matter
		which Dr. Sandwith has made his own and the
		disease is investigated carefully from every
		point of view, and notes on no less than seven
		cases are given fully. On page 312 are the
		measures recommended to the Government by
		Dr. Sandwith for dealing with the disease,
		which are moderate and practical, though we
		fear it will be difficult to deal with the cases
		mentioned in paragraph 2, where he states
		that poor peasants grow their own maize and
		eat the "worst cobs which they cannot sell."
		The opinion expressed on page 312 is well
		worthy of notice : "Of all endemic disease to
		which Egypt is subject I believe pellagra to be
		the most important."</p>
		<p>Without expressing absolute agreement with
		all the statements contained in this volume, we
		would cordially recommend it to all interested
		in Egyptian medical matters, as a valuable
		compendium of modern knowledge on the
		subject.</p>
