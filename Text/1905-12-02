          GRAVE EVENTS AT TZARSKOE SELO.
          THE END AT HAND

              <p>Things in Russia are undoubtedly going
              from bad to worse. There are rmours to-day
              that a great coup d'Etat has taken place at
              St. Petersburg, and large numbers of Cossacks
              are said to be assembling in the Capital.</p>
              <p>A great run on the savings banks through-
              out the country is taking place, and there
              exists a general financial panic.</p>

              <p>Reuter's Agency learns from St. Petersburg
              that the attitude of the Government is consi-
              dered as suicidal, playing into the hands of
              the revolutionaries. Financial and commercial
              circles are aghast. There was a further heavy
              drop in prices both at St. Petersburg and at
              Moscow yesterday. It is openly declared in the
              Bourse and elsewhere that the days of the
              present regime are numbered.</p>

              <p>When the garrison of Fort Peter and Paul
              assembled for roll call, the artillery demanded
              the immediate release of the electrical students
              arrested on the 29th November. This demand
              was transmitted to the Commandant of the 
              fortress, who complied.</p>
              <p>It is officially confirmed that the loyal troops
              have captured the barracks occupied by the
              mutineers at Sevastopol. 2,000 of these with
              quick-firing guns have surrendered. The cruiser
              Otchakoff is gutted, but is still floating. The
              town is not damaged.</p>
              <p>A number of Guardsmen have been arrested
              at Tzarskoe Selo for presenting demands ob-
              jecting to being obliged to act as police. It is
              reported that the mutineers at Sevastopol have
              regained the upper hand.</p>

              <p>It is rumoured that a Grand Duke partici-
              pated in a plot against the Tsar. There are
              some indications of conspiracy of the officers
              of the Guards, but it is impossible to say defi-
              nitely whether any Grand Duke participated.
              Officials, however, admit the reports of grave
              events at Tzarskoe Selo.</p>
              <p>It is understood that the whole Cossack
              forces of the Empire will be mobilised.</p>
